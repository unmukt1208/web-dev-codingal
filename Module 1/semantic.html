            <h3>Christmas Trees</h3>
            <img src="Christmas Tree.webp" alt="">
            <p>Christmas trees also became popular in Victorian Britain. But these were first seen in 16th Century Germany where, at
            Christmas time, people decorated fir trees with fruit and nuts – and later sweets, paper shapes and candles. Amazingly,
            historians think the origins of this festive tradition may date back to the Romans and Ancient Egyptians, who used
            evergreen** plants and garlands as symbols of everlasting life. Wow!</p>

            <p>Christmas trees don’t just pop up overnight!
            
            On average, a Christmas tree takes 7 to 10 years to grow to the perfect size.
            
            Tree farmers carefully water and trim them every year to keep them looking healthy and full.
            
            For every tree cut down, farmers plant at least one more seedling to keep the tradition alive.</p>

            <p>Before electric lights were invented, people would light real candles on their trees!
            
            While they were beautiful, they were also a fire hazard, so people had to be very careful.
            
            Today, we use electric lights that twinkle safely, making trees sparkle even more than ever!</p>

            <p>Did you know there’s a giant Christmas tree right outside the White House in the USA every year?
            
            This tradition started in 1923, and each president lights the National Christmas Tree as part of a big ceremony with
            music and decorations.
            
            Inside the White House, there are often dozens of Christmas trees in different rooms!

            <p>The smell of a real Christmas tree is one of the best parts of the holiday season!
            
            The fresh pine scent comes from oils in the tree’s needles, which are designed to keep bugs away and keep the tree green
            all winter long.
            
            These trees are called “evergreens” because they keep their colour all year round.</p>

            <p>Have you heard of the Christmas pickle?
            
            It’s a German tradition where a pickle ornament is hidden in the Christmas tree.
            
            On Christmas morning, the first person to find the pickle wins a special prize or gets to open the first present.
            
            This fun tradition has spread to many other countries!</p>
